// The private state store is encrypted at rest with PBKDF2 plus AES-GCM, so
// midnight-js requires a password provider. This is what protects the
// bidder and seller secrets on disk, and the secret is what the nullifier is derived
// from, so it matters more than it looks.
//
// The password is 32 random bytes, generated once per browser and kept in
// localStorage. It is never sent anywhere.
//
// Known tradeoff: keeping the password beside the ciphertext means encryption
// at rest protects against casual inspection of IndexedDB, not against an
// attacker who already has full access to this origin's storage. The stronger
// design is to derive the password from a wallet signature over a fixed
// message, which stores nothing and recovers on any device holding the same
// wallet. That is worth doing before auctions carry real value.
